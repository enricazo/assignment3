DATA DICTIONARY - analysis_data

This data is the result of an analysis performed on dataset "UCI HAR Dataset" as extracted from:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Two groups are analysed, the test set and the training set.
They contain the same list of variables as extracted from the "features" of the original data
The subject are identified by numbers (1 to 30)
The activities, which were numbered (1 to 6) have been renamed in a comprehensive word explaining the activity performed by the subject.
The mean and std features have been analyzed and for each of them it is computed the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Results are stored in an independent tidy data set named analysis_data.txt
The resulting file (analysis_data.txt) contains the following information:

1. "group"
	set of data
		train
		test
2. "subject"
	Number of the subject under analysis
3. "activity_label"
	Activity of the corresponding data which can have the following values
		WALKING
		WALKING_UPSTAIRS
		WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
		SITTING
		STANDING
		LAYING

4 to 135. The subsequent columns contain the mean or the standard deviation for the labelled observation values in the following order:
